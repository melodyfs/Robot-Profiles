# Robo Profiles
#### Using the iOS FileSystem

We will be practicing how to read files from the iOS filesystem. In this repository is an iOS XCode project containing a file ```robo-profiles.json``` which contains profiles of robots in json format.

## Tasks

- [x] Clone/Download this repository

- [x] Load the file ```robo-profiles.json``` from the application bundle.

- [x] Model the JSON loaded from the application bundle into Swift models (You can use Swift Codable or a Third party library for JSON Modeling)

- [x] Display the list of robo profiles(Name, Phrase, Personality, Image is optional) in a list (UITableView or UICollectionView)
